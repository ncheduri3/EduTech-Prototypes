Design Prototypes and User Tests for Education Technology apps - Guitar Tabs and Steezy Studio


I always wanted to do some work in the intersection of dance and technology and one of my course, Education Technology offered me just the opportunity and base that I needed.

I suggested improvements in the commercial Dance learning app - "Steezy Studio". The files contain the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes along with user tests. I have also included the ideation phase and how I improved upon it based on the user tests.
