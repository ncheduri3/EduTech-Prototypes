Design Prototypes and User Tests for Education Technology apps - Guitar Tabs and Steezy Studio


I always wanted to do some work in the intersection of dance and technology and one of my course, Education Technology offered me just the opportunity and base that I needed.

I suggested improvements in the commercial Online Dance platform app - "Steezy Studio". The files contain the low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/QENT3CfRSdfyC0x7CfbVzI/IndividualProject?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design)  along with [User Tests](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ChdktTWcDu85mFfRqADK0erUib5pj3lL?usp=drive_link). I have also included the ideation phase and how I improved upon it based on the user tests. 

(I don't own the images that I used from Steezy app. I have taken the images from the [website](https://www.steezy.co/) purely for academic interests.)
